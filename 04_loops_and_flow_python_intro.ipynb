    "In this module, we covered the slightly more advanced aspects of Python programming, including loops and flow control. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is working block of code that:\n",
    "1. Generates some training data using a known function for a linear regression problem.\n",
    "2. Trains a model by: \n",
    "    * Passing the training data through the model to make predictions\n",
    "    * Calculating loss\n",
    "    * Calculating gradients to update parameters\n",
    "    * Updating parameters\n",
    "3. With each epoch, the loss is compared to determine if training should continue or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure models a lot of how AI models are trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the previous modules, review the code and see if you can understand what each part does! It's okay if it still looks pretty complex, it'll get easier with practice."
